Bayesian Linear Regression – California Housing Prices
Author: Adarsh Pratap Singh
College: Ajay Kumar Garg Engineering College – 3rd Year B.Tech
Internship: YBI Foundation – Data Science & Machine Learning with Python using AI

Project Overview
This project predicts California housing prices using Bayesian Linear Regression and includes an interactive counterfactual analysis tool. Users can change input features with sliders to see real-time predicted price updates along with 95% credible intervals, offering a deeper understanding of model uncertainty.

Features
Bayesian Linear Regression for probabilistic predictions

Dataset: California Housing from Scikit-learn

Interactive sliders for "what-if" scenario testing

Displays 95% credible intervals for each prediction

Fully executable in Google Colab
