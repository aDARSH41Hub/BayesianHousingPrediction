Project Overview
This project predicts California housing prices using Bayesian Linear Regression and includes an interactive counterfactual analysis tool. Users can change input features with sliders to see real-time predicted price updates along with 95% credible intervals, offering a deeper understanding of model uncertainty.

Features
Bayesian Linear Regression for probabilistic predictions

Dataset: California Housing from Scikit-learn

Interactive sliders for "what-if" scenario testing

Displays 95% credible intervals for each prediction

Fully executable in Google Colab
